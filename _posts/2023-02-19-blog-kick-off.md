Welcome to my blog!

This is the first time I publish any kind of text online, it is a challenge also for me to write my thoughts in a foreign language and to come up with topics that can be interesting for other people.

I still don't have a clear idea of what I will be posting, but as the famous spanish poem from Machado says:

> "Caminante, no hay camino, se hace camino al andar"

Which can be translated in english to:

> "Walker, there is no path to follow, you make the path by walking"

I don't want to get stuck overthinking what should I write, or what should I do. As the poem says, there is no path already written, the only way of finding out our path is by "walking" or trying out.

I know publishing online will definitely bring some critics and won't be easy at first, but this brings me to another skill that I want to get better at. **To not listen to negative feedback or people that laugh at the stuff you do**. I think everybody in this world can bring something positive and meaningful to other people, and you don't need to be the brightest, the most experienced or the most famous person in the room to do it. I do embrace you too, reader, to start that project or whatever it is that you are scared of doing because of what other people can think of!

I'm very excited about this new Blog, I want to thank you for taking the time to read me ðŸ˜„ I have some posts already in mind that I want to make, don't want to spoil anyone, so you should keep checking out to know about it.

I'm still figuring out how I will alert you about the new entries, I have in mind creating an email feed, and creating a post on LinkedIn aswell whenever they pop. Will keep you updated.

Have a great day ðŸŒž
