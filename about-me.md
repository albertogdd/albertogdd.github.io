#### Hi, Hallo, Servus, Hola! My name is Alberto,

I've been playing around with computers since I was a kid. I'm originally from **Madrid** 🇪🇸, but I always had a dream about living in a different country, which I made true coming to **Innsbruck** 🇦🇹 back in February 2020.

I started my working career as a **Java Engineer** 👨‍💻, which I truly loved back in the time. After some years I wanted to have a new challenge, fill some knowledge gaps I had and learn new skills, seeing the potential of hyperscalers, the cloud and how interesting were all the new emerging technologies around it, I decided to shift towards **Cloud Engineering** ☁️, which is my current job.

In this blog I write whatever it comes to my head, IT related or not. Join me in this journey and feel free to contact me! You can find my email and LinkedIn profile at the bottom of the page. ✌️
